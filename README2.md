# ServiceDiscovery

Service discovery is conceptually quite simple: its key component is the registry, which is a database of the network locations of the available service instances.

The service discovery mechanism updates the service registry when service instances start and stop. When a ServiceClient invokes a service, the service discovery mechanism queries the registry to obtain a list of available service instances and routes the request to one of them.

## Client-side

A service client retrieves the list of available service instances from the service registry and load balances across them.

- Registration: Services register themselves in the registry on startup and deregister on shutdown.
- ServiceClient: Uses registry to find correct and healthy endpoints for services. Selection is done based on name or tags
- Health: periodically check registered services
- Registries: FileSystem, Consul (TODO:CosmosDb/Azure Storage Table)

## Server-side

A service client makes a request to a router, which is responsible for service discovery and forwarding (reverse-proxy).
